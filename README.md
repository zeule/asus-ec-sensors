## Linux HWMON sensors driver for ASUS motherboards to read sensor data from the embedded controller

Many ASUS motherboards do not publish all the available sensors via the Super I/O chip but the missing ones are
available through the embedded controller (EC) registers.

The EC registers do not provide critical values for the sensors and as such they are not published to the HWMON.

This driver is available in the mainline kernel since version 5.18, and code in this repository is kept in sync with
the hwmon-next branch.

## Installation

[Gentoo ebuild](https://github.com/zeule/gentoo-zeule/tree/master/sys-power/asus-ec-sensors) and 
[AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/asus-ec-sensors-dkms-git) are available. Alternatively,
you can clone the repository and then use standard `make` and `make modules_install` (as root) commands.
If you use DKMS, `make dkms` will build the module and add it to the DKMS tree for future updates.
